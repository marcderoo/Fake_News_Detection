## What about ?

The project consists in writing a scientific mini-article reporting an experiment on an NLP problem. The approach is as follows:

- Choice of an NLP problem for which there are reference data and state-of-the-art results published in peer-reviewed conferences or journals
- Brief state-of-the-art
- Proposal and justification of an experiment to evaluate a model
- Retrieve, format and describe the data statistically
- Experiments with the proposed model
- Analysis of results and conclusion
